## Running Instructions
Compile the code on your machine using javac, then run the compiled program without any parameters. This will automatically open a Java graphics window. Once running, press an arrow key to begin, 'w' to restart the game sequence, or 'q' to quit the game and terminate the program.

## Future improvements
Currently, the snake is able to run itself over without losing the game. Also, Java graphics variables are hard-coded into the graphics painting method. These should be made to be easily customizable, along with the size of the graphics window. Future improvements could also gradually speed up snake's movement as the game goes on.
